# Program Design Assignment

So apparently, this is our very first project/assignment for the first semester, all of these are done in Python, and a few external modules of it. 
---
## Disclaimer
This is just a small project that we have to build as a very beginner of this coding journey, we've done it in a month and few weeks, spent most of the time developing(and learning how to develop it) the GUI and the functionality itself . Any of the codes you seen here were not optimized at all, it's just straight up what comes up to our mind , and we just hard coded it. There might be some bugs out there that we did not notice or known at all, but we did the best we could to get rid of all of the bugs that we are aware of. Also, there might be some mistakes in language wise, like the word choice we're using and all , so yea...

## Modules you need to install to use this program (some of them are built in modules)
-tkinter
-sqlite3
-datetime
-passlib (yes , we also added the password hashing functionality)

##How to start this program?
1.Run mainmenu.py <br>
2.And start enjoy using it :) <br>
table.py is used to generate the sqlite blank table, if you wondered

## Admin ID & Password
ID:
1.yk <br>
2.kahtir<br>
3.cl<br>
4.thanir<br>
Password: 123

In case if you wondered what are the passwords for all of the users out there, it's 123 as well
